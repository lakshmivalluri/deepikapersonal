            Promises made, promises kept. It's time to say sayonara. Tokyo has been richly rewarding for Indian athletes, and all good things must come to an end. Of course, there's that temptation to sign off with one final flourish. So, on an overcast, drizzly Sunday, para shuttlers Krishna Nagar and Noida's district magistrate Suhas Yathiraj did just that.
            A historic gold and silver finish at the Yoyogi National Stadium capped off the country's remarkable Paralympics and Olympics Games show.
            India concluded its campaign with an astonishing 19 medals, including five gold, to finish 24th among 162 participating nations in the overall tally on the basis of gold medal count. The country was placed 20th based on the total numbers of medals (19) won. The medal count also included eight silver and six bronze.
            India had sent its largest contingent-ever with 54 para athletes competing in nine sporting disciplines. Seventeen of them left Tokyo with medals, including multiple winners - shooters Avani Lakhera (gold-bronze) and Singhraj Adhana (silver-bronze).
