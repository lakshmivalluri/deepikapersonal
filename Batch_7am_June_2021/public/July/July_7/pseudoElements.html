		</h3>
		<p>
			In a historic move, a new ‘Ministry of Cooperation’ has been created by the Narendra Modi Government to realise the vision of ‘Sahkar se Samriddhi’ (prosperity from cooperation).

			Government sources told CNN-News18 that the ministry would provide a separate administrative, legal and policy framework to strengthen the cooperative movement in the country. It will also help deepen cooperatives as a true people-based movement reaching upto the grassroots.

			The creation of a new ministry comes a day ahead of the much-awaited cabinet reshuffle.

			“In our country, a co-operative based economic development model is very relevant where each member works with a spirit of responsibility,” a source said.
