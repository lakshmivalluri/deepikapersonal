			KOLKATA: A tweet on Sunday morning from Congress’s official Twitter handle on the Pegasus snoopgate featuring Trinamool’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, saying how he was targeted because of the Bengal polls, found a response from TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien with the “Khela Hobe” slogan.
			Incidentally, the warmth between Congress and TMC on social media came a day before Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee flies to Delhi, where she is expected to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other senior opposition leaders.
